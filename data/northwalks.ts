      "Paddle through a landscape of towering cliffs and deep valleys on the magical Whanganui Journey. You'll travel through calm waters and foaming rapids, on an unforgettable trip into the heart of the Whanganui National Park. Experience the beauty, history and culture of the mighty Whanganui River in the south-west of the North Island. Choose a 5-day journey from Taumarunui to Pipiriki (145 km), or a shorter, 3-day journey starting at Whakahoro (88 km), featuring the most spectacular stretches of the river. In 2017 the Whanganui River was legally recognised as Te Awa Tupua, a living and indivisible whole from the mountains to the sea, its tributaries and all its physical and metaphysical elements. Due care and respect to the river at all times has always been a key expectation of tāngata whenua and the new legal status reinforces this.",
